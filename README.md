# Aggregate Functions

## Introduction:
One of the fundamental aspects of database management is the ability to effectively analyze and aggregate data within tables. This task serves as a guide to understanding the aggregate functions in SQL, including SUM, COUNT, AVERAGE, MIN, and MAX.

## Problem statement:

1. How many rows are in the SALES table provided?

2. The business is operating in how many regions?

3. What is the total profit generated in the WEST region?

4. What is the average profit generated from the sales of the companyâ€™s product?

5. On average, how many days does it take for a customer to get their orders shipped? Create a new column (Days_to_ship)

6. How many products does the company sell?

7. Show the names and cities of the 5 customers who contributed most to the overall profit.

8. Show the sales generated by cities where total sales  is greater than 20000
